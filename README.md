# MEAN.js sample for Azure App Service

This is a sample application that you can use to follow along with the tutorial at 
[Build a PHP and MySQL web app in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service-web/app-service-web-tutorial-php-mysql). 

This sample application is taken from the official [Laravel sample task list application](https://github.com/laravel/quickstart-basic) and modified minimally to make it work with Azure App Service. For instructions on how to use Laravel, see the official repository.
